## Session 1: Lecture: ZerocostDL4Mic: Leveraging Deep Learning for Microscopy Image Analysis

Overview: In this lecture, we will explore ZerocostDL4Mic, a powerful and accessible toolbox designed to help researchers and students train deep learning models for microscopy image analysis. We will start with an introduction to deep learning and its applications in microscopy, followed by a detailed discussion of how ZerocostDL4Mic simplifies the process of building and applying neural networks, even for those with limited computational resources.

**You'll learn about:**

- The common deep learning tasks in microscopy, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- The steps involved in training models from scratch versus using transfer learning.
- How data augmentation can improve model performance.
- The importance of quality control in deep learning models, with a focus on validation and model testing.
- The lecture will feature a practical demonstration, showing how to set up and train a neural network using ZerocostDL4Mic through Google Colab's free GPU resources. We will also showcase an example experiment analyzing pancreatic cancer cell adhesion and migration.
