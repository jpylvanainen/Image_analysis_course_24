Welcome to the Bioimage Analysis for Quantitative Microscopy Course, taking place from September 30 to October 4, 2024, at BioCity Turku. This course will introduce you to the fundamental concepts and practical skills needed for bioimage analysis, focusing on microscopy data. We will cover image processing using FIJI, moving from basic image inspection to more advanced tasks like preprocessing, segmentation, and quantitative measurement.

**Instructors:**

Hanna Grobe, Åbo Akademi University, hanna.grobe@abo.fi <br /> Elnaz Fazeli, University of Turku, elnaz.fazeli@helsinki.fi

# Session 1: Fiji Basics

This first session will cover image processing using FIJI, moving from basic image inspection to more advanced tasks like preprocessing, segmentation, and quantitative measurement.

**You'll Learn About:**

- FIJI Basics: A hands-on introduction to FIJI software for bioimage analysis.
- Image Calculations and Processing: Steps involved in inspecting, preprocessing, segmenting, and measuring microscopy images.
- Practical Exercises: Several opportunities to practice and apply what you've learned during the session, with guidance and feedback.
- Collaborative Learning: Interact with peers to share insights and problem-solving techniques.

# Session 2: ImageJMacro Introduction
A first introduction to scripting in Fiji using the ImageJ Macro language. Material was prepared by Anna Klemm, shortened and adjusted to the target audience and presented by Elnaz Fazeli for the Image analysis workshop, organized by Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.

Learning Outcomes
After the session you will be able to:
- Record workflows for automation and documentation
- Explain the concepts of variables, and for-loops and use them within the ImageJ macro language.
- Using sub-section of ROI-Manager via scripting.
- Batch-execute code on all images of one folder.
- Independently explore new functionalities of ImageJ macro scripting within the Built-in macro functions.
- Create your own script to automate your workflows

Prerequisites
To be able to follow the course you need to know basic image analysis concepts and how to apply them using Fiji:
- pixel scaling (pixel size)
- handling of multi-channel images
- segmentation by applying an global threshold
- “analyze particles” (connected component analysis)
- ROIs
- performing measurements
