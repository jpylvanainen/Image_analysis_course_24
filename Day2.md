By the end of this session, you'll have hands-on experience in training your own deep learning model and applying it to microscopy data.

## Session 3: Hands-on: How to evaluate the quality of your model

In this hands-on session, , we will focus on Quality Control (QC) for deep learning (DL) models, particularly in the context of DL-based segmentation in microscopy. Ensuring that models perform accurately and generalize well beyond the training data is crucial. This session will walk you through the importance of quality control in deep learning, the steps to evaluate model performance, and how to inspect model outputs through various QC methods.

**You'll learn about:**

- Why Quality Control is Essential: Understanding the role of QC in reducing errors, detecting biases, and ensuring model robustness.
- Steps in Quality Control: How to monitor training and validation loss, prevent overfitting, and determine when further training is no longer necessary.
- Visual Inspection and Error Mapping: Learn to visually inspect the loss function, map errors, and use quality metrics like IoU (Jaccard Index), F1 score (Dice Coefficient), and mean matched score.
- Model Evaluation: Comparing different models trained with various numbers of epochs to assess their performance and track accuracy using TrackMate.

By the end of this session, you will be equipped to conduct thorough quality control checks on your own models, ensuring that they perform well on unseen data and are reliable for real-world applications.

## Session 4: Hands-on: Applying StarDist to unseen dataset

In Part 3 of this hands-on session, we will focus on applying a trained deep learning model to unseen data. You will learn how to choose a model based on its training history and apply it to a new dataset for cell segmentation and tracking. 

**You'll learn about:**

- Model Selection for Unseen Data: How to select the most appropriate model from a list of options (trained with different epochs) to apply to new data.
- Batch Processing: Applying the chosen model to a whole folder of images for efficient data analysis.

By the end of this session, you'll be able to confidently apply your trained models to new datasets, perform tracking, and complete your image analysis workflow.
