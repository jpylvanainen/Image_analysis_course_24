# Session 1: Lecture: Analysis of cell behavior using TrackMate and CellTracksColab

In this session, we will focus on the analysis of cell behavior using two powerful tools: TrackMate and CellTracksColab. These tools enable the tracking and analysis of particles and cells in microscopy data, providing insights into dynamic cellular processes. You will learn how to use these tools for data tracking, analysis, and visualization in a user-friendly and efficient manner.

> **[Lecture](https://github.com/jpylvanainen/Image_analysis_course_24/blob/main/Presentations/Day4.1_Trackmate_lecture_2024.pdf)**

**You'll Learn About:**
- TrackMate: An open-source plugin for FIJI/ImageJ, designed to track particles and cells in 2D microscopy images. We'll cover key features like object detection, various tracking algorithms (LAP, Kalman filter), and data visualization and export options.
- CellTracksColab: A cloud-based tool for analyzing cell tracking data with no need for local installations. You’ll learn how to use Google Colab to process and analyze large-scale tracking data, filter tracks, and extract meaningful metrics in real time.
- Tracking in Cell Biology: The importance of particle and object tracking in cell biology, including its applications in studying cell motility, organelle movement, and molecular dynamics.
- Workflow for TrackMate and CellTracksColab: Step-by-step guide on using both tools, from data preparation and preprocessing to segmentation, tracking, and analysis.

By the end of this session, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to track cells and particles using TrackMate, analyze complex tracking datasets with CellTracksColab, and extract meaningful biological insights from your microscopy data.

# Session 2: Hands-on: Tracking using Trackmate

In this TrackMate Workshop, you will gain hands-on experience in using TrackMate, a powerful tracking tool available as a plugin in FIJI for analyzing particle and cell movements in microscopy data. This session will focus on tracking T-cell behavior and exporting meaningful tracking data for further analysis.

> **[Download video for creating tracking settings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XM86ExLCPQM8se7heTI9SI_jNJcPR_-_/view?usp=drive_link)** <br />
> **[Download tracking datasets for T cell dataset ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QgwCfLysMCyodSnwkpVoGLC3e_Xr3x5J?usp=drive_link)** (2,2 GB, backup)

You'll Learn About:

- TrackMate Setup and Workflow:
  - Use the TrackMate interface to define tracking parameters for T-cell data.
  - Save settings as an XML file and apply them across multiple datasets using TrackMate Batcher.
- Exporting Data: Learn how to export tracking results into spot tables, track tables, and movies for downstream analysis.

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to efficiently use TrackMate for tracking in microscopy images, automate the process for batch analysis, and export detailed tracking data for further use in your research projects.

# Session 3: Hands-on: Track analysis using CellTracksColab

In this session we are going to use the CellTracksColab platform to investigate tracking results. We will use the tracking data generated in the previous session(s) and see how CellTracksColab helps us to plot large datasets.

> **[Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P0s1Uy419S7hgleyeX3YkTN33DviiwVO/view?usp=sharing)**

You'll Learn About:

- The CellTracksColab workflow
  - How to upload your data into the CellTracksColab platform
  - How to generate meaningful plots from your large tracking datasets

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to use CellTracksColab on the provided datasets and your own data.
